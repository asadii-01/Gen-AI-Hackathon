## PART 2: DEBATE TOPICS WITH ARGUMENT MAPS

### Topic 1: Climate Policy
**Resolution**: "Economic growth should prioritize environmental sustainability, even if it means slower short-term growth"

**Persona A (James Patterson, 1995 Oil Exec) - Key Arguments:**
1. **Energy = Freedom**: Economic growth requires affordable energy; fossil fuels are cheapest, most reliable source
2. **Environmental Progress Requires Wealth**: Rich countries can afford environmental protection; poor countries need development first
3. **Jobs Matter**: Environmental regulations destroy American jobs, export them to countries with no standards
4. **Technology Will Solve Problems Later**: We'll innovate our way out; no need for drastic action now
5. **America First**: Why should US sacrifice when China and India don't?

**Persona B (Sarah Chen, 2024 Scientist) - Key Arguments:**
1. **Tipping Points Irreversible**: Climate system has thresholds; delay means passing points of no return
2. **Renewables Cheaper Now**: Solar/wind already cheaper than coal/gas in most markets; false trade-off
3. **Intergenerational Justice**: Current growth steals from future generations' ability to thrive
4. **Economic Costs of Inaction**: Climate damages already costing billions; will get worse
5. **Co-benefits**: Clean air, energy independence, innovation leadership

**Curveball Student Interventions:**
- "What about nuclear power? Is that a compromise?"
- "China just built more coal plants—doesn't that make US action pointless?"
- "How do you respond to the degrowth movement that says we need to shrink GDP?"

---

### Topic 2: AI Regulation
**Resolution**: "Advanced AI development should be paused until adequate safety frameworks exist"

**Persona C (Marcus Webb, 2014 Tech Libertarian) - Key Arguments:**
1. **Innovation Saves Lives**: AI will cure cancer, solve energy, prevent car accidents—delay kills people
2. **Regulation Benefits Incumbents**: Big companies can afford compliance; startups can't—regulation entrenches Google/Facebook
3. **Cannot Put Genie Back**: If US pauses, China accelerates; we lose competitive edge AND safety influence
4. **Unknown Unknowns**: We don't know enough to regulate yet; premature rules lock in wrong standards
5. **Consumer Choice**: People want AI products; who are regulators to deny them?

**Persona D (Amara Okafor, 2024 Safety Researcher) - Key Arguments:**
1. **Capability Jumps Unpredictable**: We didn't expect GPT-4 capabilities; next jump could be catastrophic
2. **Alignment Unsolved**: We don't know how to control smarter-than-human AI; building anyway is reckless
3. **Corporate Incentives Misaligned**: Companies prioritize speed over safety; see Boeing 737 MAX, Theranos, social media harms
4. **Dual Use Risk**: Bad actors can use AI for bioweapons, cyberattacks, propaganda at scale
5. **Precedent Exists**: We pause for clinical trials, nuclear testing, gene editing—why not AI?

**Curveball Student Interventions:**
- "What about open-source models that anyone can download? Can you really regulate those?"
- "Isn't existential risk speculative? Should we really pause for hypothetical threats?"
- "How do you define 'advanced AI' in a way that's enforceable?"

---

### Topic 3: Healthcare Access
**Resolution**: "Healthcare is a human right that should be guaranteed by the government"

**Persona E (Robert Thornton, 1985 Economist) - Key Arguments:**
1. **Rights Require Providers**: If healthcare is a "right," who is forced to provide it? Doctors become state employees
2. **Shortages Inevitable**: Price controls create waiting lists; see UK, Canada—people die waiting
3. **Quality Declines**: No competition means no incentive to improve; government-run = mediocrity
4. **Costs Explode**: Without market discipline, demand is infinite; taxpayers bear unlimited burden
5. **Freedom Diminished**: Choice is eliminated; government decides what care you get

**Persona F (Elena Vasquez, 2024 Advocate) - Key Arguments:**
1. **Moral Baseline**: In wealthy society, no one should die preventable death or face bankruptcy from illness
2. **Existing System Fails**: 500,000 medical bankruptcies annually; 30 million uninsured; worse outcomes than peers
3. **Administrative Waste**: US spends 30% on administration vs. 15% in single-payer; enough to cover uninsured
4. **Preventive Care Saves Money**: Uninsured people wait until ER, costing more; primary care prevents
5. **Labor Mobility**: People stay in jobs they hate for insurance; single-payer enables entrepreneurship

**Curveball Student Interventions:**
- "What about the VA? Isn't that government-run healthcare with massive problems?"
- "How would you handle immigration—do undocumented people get coverage?"
- "What role should private insurance play in a single-payer system?"
